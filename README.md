In Financial market, various shares, bonds,
securities or currencies are traded on the daily basis , thus
making most of the datasets as time series data where price is
plotted against a time series . There are many techniques and
analysis technique that can be used with times series data like
ARIMA model, exponential Smoothing, Neural Networks or
Simple Moving average. However ARIMA Model is commonly
used to understand time series analysis in order to extract
meaningful characteristics of the data and help in the prediction
of the stock prices. since it helps to understand what
happened in past and past behavior of data can help to predict
future. Time series is a special property and different set of
predictive algorithm.
